React bare-bones starter kit
=========================

A very simple but powerful starting point for building applications with React using some of the best tools currently available.

Includes:

* Build tools and dev server from [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)
* Hot reloading of React components thanks to [react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)
* Tomorrow's JavaScript today with [Babel](http://babeljs.io/)
* Super fast unit testing powered by [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html) and [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/)

```
git clone https://github.com/rob-balfre/react-bare-bones-starter-kit.git
cd react-bare-bones-starter-kit
npm install
```

Start webpack and the dev server
```
npm start
```
Open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser of choice.


Run test suite
```

```
